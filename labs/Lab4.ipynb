    "with a regularization parameter $\\lambda > 0$. It turns out that for a suitably chosen parameter $\\lambda$ (depending on the noise level and the problem) the exact solution of the regularized problem (here with [Tikhonov regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization)) is often a more accurate reconstruction than a solution of the unregularized problem (though there are typically better regularization alternatives). The optimality condition now reads $0 = A^* (A \\alpha - g) + \\lambda \\alpha$. For the reconstruction problem described in lab 3, find a regularized solution for some choice of $\\lambda$ using the conjugate gradient method and plot the relative error. Then, try to find a good choice of the parameter $\\lambda$ with the L-curve method - can be found in MÃ¼ller&Siltanen. For the L-curve you should not do a full reconstruction for each $\\lambda$, but only a few iterations to save time. Compare with the Landweber solution.\n",

    "* You can form the [identity operator](https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/generated/odl.operator.default_ops.IdentityOperator.html) of a space and add a scaled version of it to another operator, in order to implement Tikhonov regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are many [algorithmic solvers](https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/odl.solvers.html) available in ODL, including the [conjugate gradient](https://odlgroup.github.io/odl/generated/odl.solvers.iterative.iterative.conjugate_gradient.html) method, for which you need to make your operator self-adjoint."
