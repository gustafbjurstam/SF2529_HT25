    "with a regularization parameter $\\lambda > 0$. It turns out that for a suitably chosen parameter $\\lambda$ (depending on the noise level and the problem) the exact solution of the regularized problem (called [Tikhonov regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization)) is a more accurate reconstruction than a solution of the unregularized problem (though there are typically better regularization alternatives). The optimality condition now reads $0 = A^t (A \\alpha - g) + \\lambda \\alpha$. For the reconstruction problem described in lab 3, find a regularized solution for some choice of $\\lambda$ using the conjugate gradient method and plot the relative error. Then, try to find a good choice of the parameter $\\lambda$ with the L-curve method. For the L-curve you should not do a full reconstruction for each $\\lambda$, but only a few iterations to save time. Compare with the Landweber solution."
